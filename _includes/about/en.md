My name is Xiao Jun(肖均), or GwanSiu, a master student in HongKong Polytechnic University. My interest is computer vision, finance and economy. Sometimes, I would study the math which is the foundation of all.

My mainly research is face recognition, machine learning and deep learning. The programme language I used is Python. I can handle the deep learning framwork, such as caffe, tensorflow, pytorch and mxnet. [Github](https://github.com/Gwan-Siu).

I have no job now. But I would like to find an intership in this summer holliday.
