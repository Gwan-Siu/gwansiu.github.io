My name is Xiao Jun (肖均). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the department of electronic and information engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, supervised by [Prof. Kenneth K. M. Lam](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~enkmlam/). My research interests include machine learning, image enhancement, and image restoration. I received my MSc degree (supervised by [Prof. Kenneth K. M. Lam](http://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/~enkmlam/)) with distinction from the department of electronic and information engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, in 2018. Before coming to the Hong Kong Polytechnic Unversity, I obtained my BSc degree from the Guangdong University of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Wing-Kuen Ling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OofKJWMAAAAJ&hl=en), in 2016.
